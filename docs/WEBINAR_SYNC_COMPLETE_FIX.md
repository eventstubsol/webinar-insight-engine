# Webinar Sync Empty Columns - Complete Fix

## Issue Summary
The webinar sync was completing successfully, but columns like `host_first_name`, `host_last_name`, `actual_start_time`, and `actual_duration` were showing as empty in the Supabase table editor.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing Database Columns (Fixed)
The columns were missing from the database table. This was fixed by adding the migration file.

### 2. Frontend Data Mapping Issue (Fixed)
The frontend code was not mapping the new database columns when fetching data. The `transformDatabaseWebinars` function was only returning a limited set of fields.

## Complete Fix Applied

### 1. Database Migration (Already Applied)
- Added all missing columns via migration file `20250526_add_missing_webinar_columns.sql`

### 2. Updated TypeScript Types
- Updated `src/hooks/zoom/types.ts` to include all new fields in the `ZoomWebinar` interface

### 3. Updated Database Query Transform
- Updated `src/hooks/zoom/services/databaseQueries.ts` to map all database columns when fetching data

## Next Steps

1. **Pull the latest changes** from the main branch:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Restart your development server** to ensure the new TypeScript changes are loaded:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Run a manual sync** from the navbar or individual webinar page

4. **Verify the data** - The columns should now show data in the Supabase table editor

## Important Notes

- The edge functions were already correctly fetching and storing the data
- The issue was that the frontend wasn't displaying the stored data
- No additional database changes are needed
- The sync process will now properly display all the enhanced data

## Data Now Available

After these fixes, the following data will be visible:

- **Host Information**: first name, last name, display name
- **Actual Timing**: actual start time and duration for completed webinars
- **URLs**: join URL, registration URL, start URL, password
- **Settings**: all webinar configuration settings
- **And more**: All fields that were being fetched but not displayed
