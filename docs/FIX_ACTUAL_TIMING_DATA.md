# Fix for Actual Timing Data Not Syncing

## Problem
The `actual_start_time` and `actual_duration` columns are not being populated in the `zoom_webinars` table even after the database migration and frontend fixes.

## Root Cause
The actual timing data is only available from Zoom's Past Webinar API, which requires:
1. The webinar to have already occurred (past the scheduled start time)
2. Special API endpoints to fetch the actual execution data
3. The webinar status might not always be "ended" even for completed webinars

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Timing Data Processor
Updated `supabase/functions/zoom-api/handlers/sync/actualTimingDataProcessor.ts` to:
- Check all webinars that are past their scheduled start time (not just those with "ended" status)
- Try multiple methods to get timing data:
  1. **Occurrence API**: For recurring webinars with multiple instances
  2. **UUID API**: Using the webinar UUID to fetch past webinar data
  3. **Instances API**: As a fallback method

### 2. Added Detailed Logging
Updated `supabase/functions/zoom-api/handlers/sync/nonDestructiveSync.ts` to:
- Log how many webinars have timing data before upserting
- Log the actual timing data being upserted for each webinar
- Track timing data updates in the database

## How to Test

1. **Deploy the updated edge functions** to Supabase:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy zoom-api
   ```

2. **Run a manual sync** from the application

3. **Check the edge function logs** in Supabase Dashboard:
   - Go to Functions → zoom-api → Logs
   - Look for logs with "TIMING DATA CHECK" and "actual_start_time"
   - You should see detailed logs about which webinars have timing data

4. **Verify in the database**:
   - Check the `zoom_webinars` table
   - Look for past webinars (start_time < current time)
   - The `actual_start_time` and `actual_duration` columns should now have data

## What the Fix Does

1. **Identifies Past Webinars**: Any webinar with a start time before the current time is considered for timing enhancement
2. **Multiple API Attempts**: Tries different Zoom API endpoints to get the actual timing data
3. **Detailed Logging**: Provides visibility into what data is being fetched and stored
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Falls back to different methods if one fails

## Troubleshooting

If timing data is still not appearing:

1. **Check Edge Function Logs**:
   - Look for `[zoom-api][enhanceWebinarsWithActualTimingData]` entries
   - Check for any error messages or warnings
   - Verify that past webinars are being identified

2. **Verify Zoom API Permissions**:
   - Ensure your Zoom app has the necessary scopes:
     - `webinar:read`
     - `webinar:read:admin`
     - `dashboard:read:admin` (for some past webinar data)

3. **Check Specific Webinar Status**:
   - Some webinars might not have timing data if they were cancelled or not actually held
   - The logs will show which API methods were tried and why they failed

## Expected Results

After the fix:
- Past webinars should have `actual_start_time` and `actual_duration` populated
- The logs should show successful timing data enhancement
- The database should reflect the actual execution times, not just scheduled times
